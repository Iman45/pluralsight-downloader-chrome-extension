# Pluralsight Downloader Chrome Extension

Chrome Extension to download Pluralsight courses

Author: **Sahil Sehwag**

## Inspiration and Why

This chrome extension is a clone of project [**Pluralsight Course Downloader**](https://github.com/vatz88/Pluralsight-Course-Downloader) by [**vatz88**](https://github.com/vatz88). 
<br><br>
The old extension stopped working because of the changes in entire Pluralsight strcuture. Along with this there were some issues in that project. So I rewrote the extension, but interface is exactly same (`s`, `a`). Another reason is that I will be maintaing this repository and will probably add more features.

## Installation

Clone the repository to your system or download it as [.tar.gz](https://github.com/vatz88/Pluralsight-Course-Downloader/tarball/master).

Follow this [guide](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked) to load extension in developer mode in Chrome browser.

## Usage

Hit the `s` key while watching the video on pluralsight and it'll be downloaded and organized in folder with appropriate file name!

Hit the `a` key while watching the video on pluralsight and it'll be downloaded and organized in folder with appropriate file name! Subsequent videos in queue will automatically download after some seconds. **Note:** After pressing `a` don't interupt the course player, the extension will automatically play the next video and start the download and so on.
